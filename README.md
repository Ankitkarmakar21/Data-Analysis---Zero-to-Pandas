## Data-Analysis---Zero-to-Pandas - Jovian.ai

In this project,we are trying to analyze the data of a finance company who deals in different types of loans. They first check the eligibility with some checklist and the provide loans on the basis of it. The sheet contains data of approx 614 customers ranging from Urban to rural areas, graduate/Non graduate customers.

Here I have divided this entire project into three different section.
1.) Downloading the dataset and performing some cleaning(if required) and deriving some basic information of the data.
2.) Visualizing the datasets using graphs
3.) Inferences and Future work that can be done using this dataset.

we have used kaggle as the source to download the data : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset
Here our basic aim was to get some details about loan approved and loan rejected. The above dataset can be used to predict if a new person who applies for loan is eligible to get loan. This can be done using ML techniques.
